<h3>Thank you for participating</h3>

<p>
    The purpose of this study is to examine how people evaluate and use advice
    when it is provided by different types of sources.
</p>

<p>
    During the study, participants were randomly assigned to one of two scenarios.
    In one scenario, the advice was presented as coming from an AI-based system,
    while in the other scenario, the same advice was presented as coming from a human tutor.
</p>

<p>
    By comparing responses across these two conditions, we aim to better understand
    how the perceived source of advice influences trust, confidence, and decision-making.
</p>

<p>
    Thank you very much for your time and valuable contribution to this research.
